# Django ToDo list

This is a to-do list web application with the basic features of most web apps, i.e., accounts/login, API, and interactive UI. To do this task, you will need:

- CSS | [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
- JS  | [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Explore

Try it out by installing the requirements (the following commands work only with Python 3.8 and higher, due to Django 4):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a database schema:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

And then start the server (default is http://localhost:8000):

```
python manage.py runserver
```

You can now browse the [API](http://localhost:8000/api/) or start on the [landing page](http://localhost:8000/).

## Task

Create a Kubernetes manifest for a pod that will contain a ToDo app container:

1. Fork this repository.
1. Create a `confgiMap.yml` file for ConfigMap resource.
1. ConfigMap requirements:
    3.1. ConfigMap should have a `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` value set
    3.2. Deployment should use this ConfigMap and set the `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` environment variable
1. Create a `secret.yml` file for the Secret resource.
1. Secret requirements:
5.1. Secret should have a `SECRET_KEY` value set
5.2. Deployment should use this Secret and set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable
5.3. Application should use this secret instead of one hardcoded in `settings.py`
1. Create the `INSTRUCTION.md` with commands to apply all the changes
1. `INSTRUCTION.md` should have instructions on how to validate the changes
1. Create PR with your changes and attach it for validation on a platform.

## How to apply changes

```bash
kubectl apply -f .infrasctructure/configMap.yml
kubectl apply -f .infrasctructure/secret.yml
kubectl apply -f .infrasctructure/deployment.yml
```

## How to validate changes

Check if ConfigMap and Secret were created:

```bash
kubectl get configmap todoapp-config -o jsonpath='{.data.PYTHONUNBUFFERED}'
kubectl get secret todoapp-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.SECRET_KEY}'
```

Check environment variables in the deployment:

```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/todoapp -- env | grep PYTHONUNBUFFERED
kubectl exec -it deployment/todoapp -- env | grep SECRET_KEY
```

Check if application is working:

```bash
kubectl port-forward deployment/todoapp 8080:8080
```

And then open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
